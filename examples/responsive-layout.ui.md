# Responsive Layout Example

This spec demonstrates `@breakpoint` responsive directives (Option C).
Each directive scopes design tokens to a viewport size using the blockquote
hint syntax already supported by the DSL. Directives are mobile-first and
additive — `@sm` sets the base, larger breakpoints layer on top.

## Why Responsive DSL?
Design-system tokens map cleanly to Tailwind responsive prefixes,
Flutter LayoutBuilder constraints, or Bootstrap infix classes —
depending on your target framework.
